# Yet Another Oxygen Analyser
For the purpose of analysing the oxygen content of SCUBA diving breathing gases. Yes it's essentially just a fancy voltmeter, like one thousand other DIY analysers before it. Reads the voltage of electro chemical oxygen cell (a fuel cell) which is proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen that it is exposed to. Calibrating that to a known gas and you can read the percentage of oxygen in another gas. Fraction of the cost of comercial analysers and a fun project.

# Features
**Easy to read OLED display** Includes the MOD calculations (in Meters) for ppo2 of 1.4 and 1.6

**Display Hold button.** Keeps the measurement value on the screen so that you can write it onto your contents label / MOD sticker on your tank

**Temperature and Humidity compensated calibration.** Automatically compentating the calibration point for the measured atmospheric humidity and temperature. If you calibrate to atmospheric air, then you should account for the humidity and temperature. The calibration value in that case is not always the 20.9% that you might use.

**Pushbutton power on/off with auto-off timer.** Five minutes without pressing any button and it will power itself off to a practically zero draw state so your batter will not be worn out when you forget to switch it off. This may be more important for this analyser compared to traditional DIY LCD panel meter based analysers since it will draw more current when it is on and is still only using a standard 9V battery.

**Battery voltage monitor.** You can know when you will soon need to replace the batter and not get caught out.
